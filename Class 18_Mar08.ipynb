    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",

    "Inferential statistics allows you to make predictions (“inferences”) from that data. With inferential statistics, you take data from samples and make generalizations about a population. For example, you might stand in a mall and ask a sample of 100 people if they like shopping at Sears. You could make a bar chart of yes or no answers (that would be descriptive statistics) or you could use your research (and inferential statistics) to reason that around 75-80% of the population (all shoppers in all malls) like shopping at Sears.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main areas of inferential statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimating parameters. This means taking a statistic from your sample data (for example the sample mean) and using it to say something about a population parameter (i.e. the population mean).\n",
    "- Hypothesis tests. This is where you can use sample data to answer research questions. For example, you might be interested in knowing if a new cancer drug is effective. Or if breakfast helps children perform better in schools.\n",

If the sample being tested falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted instead of the null hypothesis.
